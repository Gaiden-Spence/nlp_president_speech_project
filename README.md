# nlp_president_speech_project
Using nlp and unsupervised machine learning techniques to gather insights on president speeches over the decade. Using latent dirchlet allocations which gives us the probability on what unsupervised category these speeches fall under. Then testing the distributions with new text and seeing where the new text might be in those distributions. Also using word2vec to plot the word clusterings on a 2 dimensional graph and looking at specific words throughout the decades to find which words were most linked with those specific key words.
